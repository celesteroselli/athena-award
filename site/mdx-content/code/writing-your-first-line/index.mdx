### What does all this mean, anyways?

<CodeSnippet snippet={`// Put your name and age in the code below and click "Run" to see what happens!
const name = "'INPUT_TEXT:NAME:END'";
const age = 'INPUT_NUMBER:AGE:END';
const isAnAwesomeHackClubber = 'INPUT_BOOLEAN:HACK_CLUBBER:END';
console.log("My name is " + name + "!");
console.log("I am " + age + " years old.");
console.log("People have asked if I'm an awesome hack clubber, and to that I say it is " + isAnAwesomeHackClubber + " ðŸ˜Ž");`} template={`My name is NAME!
    I am AGE years old.
    People have asked if I'm an awesome hack clubber, and to that I say it is HACK_CLUBBER ðŸ˜Ž`}/>

Let's go through what this does again. The code you see above is in the language JavaScript.
<Dialogue user="Okay, but what does const mean? And what does console.log do?">
  Lines 3, 4 and 5 set the variables equal to something that you can fill in! By preceeding it with <b>const</b>, it means you can't change what the variable is equal to later on. For example, something like this <b>won't</b> work.
  <CodeSnippet snippet = {`const myName = "Heidi"
const myName = "Heidi the Hakkuun" // will cause an error!`} 
template = {``}
status = {false}/>

As for <code>console.log</code>? That just prints it to the console. If you're on a computer now, you can see what's output in the console by opening up <b>Inspect Element</b> (<Key>Ctrl</Key> + <Key>Shift</Key> + <Key>I</Key> or <Key>Command</Key> + <Key>Option</Key> + <Key>I</Key>) and pressing on the tab that says <b>Console</b>. You can even type JavaScript in the console. Give it a shot - try typing this into the console and see what happens.
<CodeSnippet snippet={`console.log("Hello, world!")`} template={``} status={false}/>

I bet you're interested in writing your own now ðŸ‘€ Look under the subheading that says <b>Resources</b>, and you'll find a link to somewhere you can write your own JavaScript.

### Welcome to the Treasure Map!

Hey there, traveller! I'm <b>Heidi</b>. Heidi Hakkuun, at your service. I hear you're in search of some treasure ðŸ‘€ 

<Dialogue user="That's right! I'm looking for the Athena Award!">
    It's dangerous to go alone - take this!

<Dialogue user="Huh, what's that?"> {/* JANK */}
    This is a guide to the entrance of Java's Crypt! Legend says you can use this to find the rarest treasures known to raccoonkind... and humans too, I suppose. 
    
    <CodeSnippet snippet={`// Put your name and age in the code below and click "Run" to see what happens!

const name = "'INPUT_TEXT:NAME:END'";
const age = 'INPUT_NUMBER:AGE:END';
const isAnAwesomeHackClubber = 'INPUT_BOOLEAN:HACK_CLUBBER:END';
console.log("My name is " + name + "!");
console.log("I am " + age + " years old.");
console.log("People have asked if I'm an awesome hack clubber, and to that I say it is " + isAnAwesomeHackClubber + " ðŸ˜Ž");
    `} template={`My name is NAME!
    I am AGE years old.
    People have asked if I'm an awesome hack clubber, and to that I say it is HACK_CLUBBER ðŸ˜Ž`}/>

    It's not much, but it's enough to get started! It might look a bit cryptic at the moment, but follow me and I'll explain what each part means.

    *Heidi scurries away on all four paws, leaving paper trailing in her wake.*
